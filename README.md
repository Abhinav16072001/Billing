# Project Name

A brief description of your project and what it does.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**

   Use the following command to clone the project's repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` and `your-repo` with your GitHub username and the name of your repository.

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   We recommend creating a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using Python's built-in `venv` module. Navigate to your project directory and run:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment. The commands for activation may vary based on your operating system. Here are some examples:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install project dependencies**

   While your virtual environment is active, install the project's dependencies using `pip` by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. **Run the FastAPI server**

   To start the FastAPI server, use the following command:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   This command will launch the server, and it will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default. You can access the server in your web browser or make API requests to it as needed.
